🔒 Fernet Encryption & Decryption Tool – A simple but secure encryption and decryption tool using Fernet (symmetric key encryption).

🔹 Description:
This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data securely using Python’s cryptography library (Fernet). It ensures data security by encrypting text with a unique key that can be used for decryption later.

🔹 Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Library: cryptography.fernet
Features:
✅ Encrypt text with a secure key
✅ Decrypt previously encrypted text
✅ Uses symmetric key encryption (Fernet)
💡 How It Works?
1️⃣ User inputs plain text
2️⃣ The tool encrypts the text using Fernet encryption
3️⃣ The encrypted text and key are displayed
4️⃣ Using the key, the text can be decrypted back
